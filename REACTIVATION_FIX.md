# üîß Account Reactivation Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Problem:** When an admin reactivated an invite code, the user accounts associated with that code remained disabled.

**Root Cause:** The `_toggleCodeStatus` function only updated the invite code's `isActive` status but didn't update the user accounts' `isActive` status.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Reactivation Flow

Now when an admin activates a previously deactivated invite code, the system:

1. **Checks if the code has associated users**
2. **Shows a confirmation dialog:**
   ```
   "Reactivate User Accounts?"
   "This code was used by X user(s). 
    Do you want to reactivate their accounts as well?"
   
   [No] [Yes, Reactivate Users]
   ```

3. **Updates the invite code** to `isActive: true`

4. **If admin chooses "Yes":**
   - Reactivates all user accounts (sets `isActive: true` for each user)
   - Shows success message: "Code activated and X user account(s) enabled"

5. **If admin chooses "No":**
   - Only the code is reactivated
   - User accounts remain disabled
   - Shows message: "Code activated (users remain disabled)"

## Complete User Flow

### Scenario 1: Full Deactivation and Reactivation

```
1. Admin deactivates invite code ABC123
2. Admin chooses "Yes, Deactivate Users"
   ‚úì Code isActive = false
   ‚úì User accounts isActive = false
   ‚úì Technician cannot login

3. Admin activates invite code ABC123
4. Admin chooses "Yes, Reactivate Users"
   ‚úì Code isActive = true
   ‚úì User accounts isActive = true
   ‚úì Technician can login again ‚Üê FIXED!
```

### Scenario 2: Code Only Deactivation

```
1. Admin deactivates invite code ABC123
2. Admin chooses "No" (don't deactivate users)
   ‚úì Code isActive = false
   ‚úì User accounts isActive = true (still active)
   ‚úì Technician can still login

3. Admin activates invite code ABC123
   ‚úì Code isActive = true
   ‚úì User accounts isActive = true (already active)
   ‚úì No change needed for users
```

### Scenario 3: Selective Reactivation

```
1. Admin deactivates code with 3 users
2. Admin chooses "Yes, Deactivate Users"
   ‚úì All 3 users disabled

3. Admin manually reactivates 1 user via Firebase Console
   ‚úì User 1: isActive = true
   ‚úì User 2: isActive = false
   ‚úì User 3: isActive = false

4. Admin activates the invite code
5. Admin chooses "Yes, Reactivate Users"
   ‚úì All 3 users reactivated (including the manually activated one)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Function: `_toggleCodeStatus`

The function now has three distinct flows:

#### Flow 1: Deactivation (when `currentStatus = true`)
```dart
if (currentStatus && usedBy.isNotEmpty) {
  // Show deactivation dialog
  // Update code: isActive = false
  // If confirmed: Update users: isActive = false
}
```

#### Flow 2: Reactivation (when `currentStatus = false` and has users) ‚Üê NEW!
```dart
else if (!currentStatus && usedBy.isNotEmpty) {
  // Show reactivation dialog ‚Üê NEW FEATURE
  // Update code: isActive = true
  // If confirmed: Update users: isActive = true ‚Üê FIXES THE ISSUE
}
```

#### Flow 3: Simple Toggle (no users affected)
```dart
else {
  // Just toggle the code status
}
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Symmetric Operations**: Deactivation and reactivation now mirror each other
‚úÖ **Admin Control**: Full control over user account status
‚úÖ **Clear Feedback**: Messages indicate exactly what happened
‚úÖ **Batch Efficient**: Uses batch operations for multiple users
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Admin can choose to reactivate users or not

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Full Cycle
```
1. Create invite code
2. Technician registers with code
3. Verify technician can login
4. Admin deactivates code ‚Üí Choose "Yes, Deactivate Users"
5. Verify technician CANNOT login
6. Admin activates code ‚Üí Choose "Yes, Reactivate Users" ‚Üê TEST THIS
7. Verify technician CAN login again ‚úì SHOULD WORK NOW
```

### Test Case 2: Code Only
```
1. Admin deactivates code ‚Üí Choose "No"
2. Verify technician can still login
3. Admin activates code
4. Verify technician can still login
```

### Test Case 3: Multiple Users
```
1. Create code with maxUses: 3
2. Three technicians register
3. Admin deactivates code ‚Üí Choose "Yes"
4. Verify all 3 technicians cannot login
5. Admin activates code ‚Üí Choose "Yes" ‚Üê TEST THIS
6. Verify all 3 technicians CAN login ‚úì SHOULD WORK NOW
```

## Files Modified

- `lib/features/admin/presentation/pages/admin_invite_codes_page.dart`
  - Updated `_toggleCodeStatus()` function (Lines 96-250)
  - Added reactivation dialog
  - Added batch user reactivation logic

## Migration Notes

**No database migration needed!** This is a code-only fix. All existing data structures remain the same.

## UI Changes

### Before Fix
```
Admin clicks "Activate" on disabled code:
‚Üí Code activated ‚úì
‚Üí Users remain disabled ‚úó
‚Üí Message: "Code activated"
```

### After Fix
```
Admin clicks "Activate" on disabled code with users:
‚Üí Dialog appears asking about users
‚Üí Admin chooses "Yes, Reactivate Users"
‚Üí Code activated ‚úì
‚Üí Users activated ‚úì
‚Üí Message: "Code activated and X user account(s) enabled"
```

## Rollout Instructions

1. **No deployment steps needed** - This is a client-side fix
2. **Test the fix:**
   - Deactivate a code with users
   - Reactivate the code
   - Choose "Yes, Reactivate Users"
   - Verify users can login

3. **Educate admins:**
   - When reactivating a code, remember to choose "Yes" to reactivate users
   - If you only want to allow new registrations with the code, choose "No"

## Summary

The issue has been fixed! Now when you reactivate an invite code, you'll see a dialog asking if you want to reactivate the associated user accounts. Choose "Yes, Reactivate Users" and the technician accounts will be enabled again, allowing them to login.

**The fix provides complete symmetry: Just as you can deactivate users when deactivating a code, you can now reactivate users when reactivating a code!** ‚úÖ
