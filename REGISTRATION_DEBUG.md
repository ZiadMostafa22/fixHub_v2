## 🔥 **CHECK FIREBASE CONSOLE:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. **Authentication** → **Users**
   - Check if the user was created
4. **Firestore Database** → **users** collection
   - Check if the user document was created

---

## 🐛 **COMMON ISSUES & FIXES:**

### Issue 1: "Permission Denied" in Firestore

**Cause:** Firestore security rules are too strict

**Fix:** Update Firestore Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write for authenticated users
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /cars/{carId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /bookings/{bookingId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    // Add more collections as needed
  }
}
```

### Issue 2: Firebase Not Initialized

**Cause:** `google-services.json` missing or incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Download latest `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
2. Place in `android/app/` folder
3. Run `flutter clean && flutter run -d R5CT6249X6F`

### Issue 3: Email Already in Use

**Cause:** You tried to register with an email that's already registered

**Fix:** Use a completely new email address

---

## 📞 **WHAT TO TELL ME:**

After you try to register, copy the **entire console output** and send it to me. Look for the section that starts with:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
🔐 REGISTRATION START
```

This will help me see exactly where the registration is failing!
