## Implementation Details

### Helper Methods:

1. **`_getUserInfo(String userId)`**
   - Fetches user data from Firestore
   - Returns Map with name and phone
   - Implements caching to avoid duplicate calls
   - Handles errors gracefully

2. **`_getTechnicianNames(List<String>? technicianIds)`**
   - Accepts list of technician IDs
   - Fetches names for all technicians
   - Returns comma-separated string
   - Shows "Not assigned" if empty

### Caching Strategy:
```dart
final Map<String, Map<String, String>> _usersCache = {};

// Check cache before Firestore call
if (_usersCache.containsKey(userId)) {
  return _usersCache[userId]!;
}

// Store in cache after fetching
_usersCache[userId] = userInfo;
```

### FutureBuilder Usage:
```dart
FutureBuilder<Map<String, String>>(
  future: _getUserInfo(booking.userId),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    final customerName = snapshot.data?['name'] ?? 'Loading...';
    final customerPhone = snapshot.data?['phone'] ?? '';
    // Display UI
  },
)
```

## Color Scheme

### Customer Information:
- **Name Icon**: Gray (Icons.person)

- **Phone Text**: Green (#388E3C) with bold weight

### Technician Information:

- **Name Text**: Blue (#1976D2) with bold weight

### Visual Hierarchy:
