# Account Deactivation Feature - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Feature Overview

This feature allows administrators to control technician accounts by deactivating invite codes. When an admin deactivates an invite code, they can also choose to disable all user accounts that were created using that code.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All components have been implemented and tested:

### 1. **User Model Updates** ✅
- Added `inviteCodeId` field to track the invite code document reference
- Added `inviteCode` field to store the actual code string for display
- Updated all model methods (fromMap, fromFirestore, toMap, toFirestore, copyWith)

**File:** `lib/core/models/user_model.dart`

### 2. **Registration Flow** ✅
- Modified signup process to save invite code reference and ID when users register
- The invite code document ID is stored in the user document
- Both the document ID and the actual code string are saved

**File:** `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart` (Lines 379-428)

### 3. **Login Security** ✅
- Added `isActive` status check during login
- Users with `isActive: false` are immediately signed out
- Clear error message displayed: "Your account has been disabled by the administrator"

**File:** `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart` (Lines 199-206)

### 4. **Admin Invite Codes Page** ✅

#### Show Associated Technicians
- Displays which technicians have used each invite code
- Shows technician names next to each code
- Real-time loading of technician information

#### Deactivate User Accounts
- When admin deactivates a code, they get a confirmation dialog
- Option to deactivate all associated user accounts
- Batch update for efficient database operations
- Clear feedback on success

**File:** `lib/features/admin/presentation/pages/admin_invite_codes_page.dart`

**Key Functions:**
- `_toggleCodeStatus()` - Handles code and user deactivation (Lines 96-181)
- `_getTechnicianNames()` - Fetches technician names from user IDs (Lines 183-206)

### 5. **Firestore Security Rules** ✅

#### New Helper Functions
```javascript
// Check if user is active
function isActive() {
  return request.auth != null && 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.get('isActive', true) == true;
}

// Check if user is authenticated AND active
function isAuthenticatedAndActive() {
  return isAuthenticated() && isActive();
}
```

#### Updated Collections
All main collections now enforce `isActive` status:
- **Users Collection** - Protects `isActive` field from user modification
- **Cars Collection** - Only active users can CRUD
- **Bookings Collection** - Only active users can create/update
- **Services Collection** - Only active users can read
- **Notifications Collection** - Only active users can access
- **Reviews Collection** - Only active users can create/update

**File:** `firestore.rules`

## 🔒 Security Features

### Multi-Layer Protection

1. **App Level (Flutter)**
   - Login blocked for inactive users
   - Error message displayed
   - Automatic sign out

2. **Database Level (Firestore)**
   - Security rules prevent data access
   - All read/write operations check `isActive` status
   - Admin operations always allowed for management

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Batch updates ensure consistency
   - Invite code tracking prevents orphaned accounts
   - Admin controls are centralized

## 📱 User Experience

### For Administrators

1. **View Invite Codes**
   ```
   Code: ABC123XY
   Role: TECHNICIAN
   Uses: 1/1
   Used by: John Doe
   ```

2. **Deactivate Code**
   - Click menu → "Deactivate"
   - If code has been used, dialog appears:
     ```
     "This code has been used by 1 user(s).
      Do you want to deactivate their accounts as well?"
     
     [No] [Yes, Deactivate Users]
     ```

3. **Feedback**
   - "Code deactivated and 1 user account(s) disabled" (if users deactivated)
   - "Code deactivated (users remain active)" (if users kept active)

### For Technicians

1. **Active Account**
   - Normal app access
   - All features available

2. **Deactivated Account**
   - Cannot login
   - Error message: "Your account has been disabled by the administrator. Please contact support for assistance."
   - Immediate sign out if logged in (on next data request)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Structure

#### Users Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "user123",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  role: "technician",
  isActive: true,  // ← Status flag
  inviteCodeId: "codeDoc123",  // ← Reference to invite code document
  inviteCode: "ABC123XY",      // ← The actual code string
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

#### Invite Codes Collection
```javascript
{
  code: "ABC123XY",
  role: "technician",
  maxUses: 1,
  usedCount: 1,
  isActive: false,  // ← Can be deactivated
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  createdBy: "adminUserId",
  usedBy: ["user123"],  // ← Array of user IDs who used this code
  lastUsedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Code Flow

#### Registration
```
1. User enters invite code during registration
2. System validates code is active and has available uses
3. Firebase Auth user created
4. Firestore user document created WITH inviteCodeId and inviteCode
5. Invite code updated: usedCount++, usedBy array updated
```

#### Login
```
1. User enters credentials
2. Firebase Auth signs in user
3. System fetches Firestore user document
4. Check isActive status
5. If false → Sign out + Error message
6. If true → Proceed to dashboard
```

#### Deactivation
```
1. Admin clicks "Deactivate" on invite code
2. Invite code isActive set to false
3. Dialog asks about associated users
4. If "Yes":
   a. Batch operation starts
   b. For each userId in usedBy array:
      - Update user document: isActive = false
   c. Batch commit
   d. Success message displayed
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Testing

- [x] New registrations save invite code reference
- [x] Login checks `isActive` status
- [x] Disabled users cannot login
- [x] Admin can see technician names on codes
- [x] Admin can deactivate codes
- [x] Admin can choose to deactivate users
- [x] Firestore rules prevent inactive user access

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Deactivate Code Only
```
1. Admin generates invite code
2. Technician registers using code
3. Technician logs in successfully
4. Admin deactivates code
5. Admin chooses "No" for deactivating users
6. Technician can still log in
7. New registrations with code fail
```

#### Scenario 2: Deactivate Code and Users
```
1. Admin generates invite code
2. Technician registers using code
3. Technician logs in successfully
4. Admin deactivates code
5. Admin chooses "Yes, Deactivate Users"
6. Technician is signed out
7. Technician cannot log in (error message shown)
8. Admin can reactivate by updating isActive in Firestore
```

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Users per Code
```
1. Admin generates invite code with maxUses: 3
2. Three technicians register using code
3. Admin deactivates code
4. Admin chooses to deactivate users
5. All three technicians are disabled
6. Confirmation shows "3 user account(s) disabled"
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Update Existing Users (if needed)
If you have existing users without the `inviteCodeId` field:
```javascript
// Run this once in Firebase Console
db.collection('users').get().then(snapshot => {
  const batch = db.batch();
  snapshot.docs.forEach(doc => {
    if (!doc.data().hasOwnProperty('isActive')) {
      batch.update(doc.ref, { isActive: true });
    }
  });
  return batch.commit();
});
```

### 3. Verify Rules
Test the rules in Firebase Console:
- Try to read data as inactive user → Should fail
- Try to write data as inactive user → Should fail
- Admin operations → Should succeed

## 📝 Notes

### Important Considerations

1. **Admin Accounts Cannot Be Disabled by Rules**
   - Admins always bypass `isActive` checks
   - This prevents admins from locking themselves out
   - Manual database edit required to disable admin

2. **Reactivation Process**
   - Update user document: `isActive: true`
   - Can be done via Firebase Console
   - Consider adding reactivation feature in admin panel

3. **Data Retention**
   - Deactivated users' data remains in database
   - Bookings, cars, and history are preserved
   - Can be useful for audit trails

4. **Performance**
   - Batch operations are efficient for multiple users
   - FutureBuilder loads technician names asynchronously
   - Firestore rules checks are fast (single document read)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Reactivation UI**
   - Add "Reactivate User" button in admin panel
   - Bulk reactivation for multiple users

2. **Audit Log**
   - Track when accounts are deactivated
   - Record admin who performed action
   - Store reason for deactivation

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Notify technician when account is deactivated
   - Include contact information for appeals

4. **Grace Period**
   - Warn users before deactivation
   - Temporary suspension vs permanent deactivation

## 🎉 Summary

The account deactivation feature is now fully implemented and ready for use. Administrators have complete control over technician accounts through the invite code system, with clear visibility of which codes are associated with which users.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Enhanced security and control
- ✅ Easy account management
- ✅ Clear audit trail via invite codes
- ✅ Multi-layer protection (app + database)
- ✅ User-friendly admin interface
- ✅ Proper error handling and feedback
