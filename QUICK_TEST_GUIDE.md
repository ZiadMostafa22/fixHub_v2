The app is now building and installing on your Android phone!

## üì± How to Test (STEP BY STEP)

### Step 1: Create a FRESH Account
Since your previous account might have issues, let's create a completely new one:

1. **Open the app** on your Android phone
2. **Tap "Sign Up"** on the login screen
3. **Fill in the form with NEW details:**
   ```
   Name: Test User
   Email: testuser123@example.com  (NEW email, not ziad@gmail.com)
   Phone: 1234567890
   Role: CUSTOMER (select from dropdown)
   Password: test1234
   Confirm Password: test1234
   ```
4. **Tap "Create Account"**
5. **EXPECTED RESULT**: You should immediately see the **Customer Dashboard** with "Welcome, Test User"

### Step 2: Test Logout
1. **Tap the logout icon** (top right corner)
2. **EXPECTED RESULT**: You should go back to the login screen

### Step 3: Test Login with Your New Account
1. **On the login screen, enter:**
   ```
   Email: testuser123@example.com
   Password: test1234
   Role: CUSTOMER
   ```
2. **Tap "Sign In"**
3. **EXPECTED RESULT**: You should immediately see the **Customer Dashboard**

### Step 4: Test with Your Original Account (ziad@gmail.com)
1. **Logout** if you're logged in
2. **Try to login with:**
   ```
   Email: ziad@gmail.com
   Password: [your actual password]
   Role: CUSTOMER (or whatever role you registered with)
   ```

**IF YOU GET "Invalid email or password" ERROR:**
- The password you're entering is wrong OR
- The account wasn't created properly

**SOLUTION:** Create a new account with a different email (like above)

## üêõ Understanding the "Invalid Credential" Error

This error means one of these:
1. **Wrong Password** - You're typing the password incorrectly
2. **Wrong Email** - The email doesn't exist in Firebase
3. **Account Not Created** - Registration failed but you didn't notice

**How to Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Use the **NEW test account** I provided above (testuser123@example.com)
- ‚úÖ Make sure you use the SAME password you registered with
- ‚úÖ Check that you're selecting the SAME role you registered with

## ‚úÖ What You Should See

### On Successful Registration:
1. Loading spinner appears briefly
2. Immediately navigates to **Customer Dashboard**
3. AppBar shows "Welcome, Test User"
4. You see Quick Actions, Upcoming Appointments, Recent Bookings

### On Successful Login:
1. Loading spinner appears briefly
2. Immediately navigates to **Customer Dashboard** (or Admin/Technician based on role)
3. No refresh or loop
4. Dashboard shows your name

### On Error:
- Red snackbar appears at the bottom
- Shows clear error message like:
  - "Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials and try again."
  - "This email is already registered. Please login instead."
  - "No account found with this email. Please register first."
