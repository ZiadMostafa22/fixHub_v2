# üö® CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - All Users Showing as Customer

## The Problem
All users (admin, technician, customer) were being logged in as customers because the login page was hardcoded to pass 'customer' role.

## The Root Cause
In `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/login_page.dart` line 19:
```dart
final String _selectedRole = 'customer'; // ‚ùå HARDCODED!
```

This was a leftover from when we removed the role dropdown from the login screen.

## The Fix Applied
**File**: `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/login_page.dart`

**Changed from:**
```dart
final String _selectedRole = 'customer';

// Later...
final success = await ref.read(authProvider.notifier).signIn(
  _emailController.text.trim(),
  _passwordController.text,
  _selectedRole, // Always 'customer'!
);
```

**Changed to:**
```dart
// Removed: final String _selectedRole = 'customer';

// Now:
final success = await ref.read(authProvider.notifier).signIn(
  _emailController.text.trim(),
  _passwordController.text,
  '', // Empty string - auth provider will auto-detect from Firestore
);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User enters email/password** and clicks login
2. **Login page passes empty role** to auth provider
3. **Auth provider**:
   - Authenticates with Firebase Auth
   - Loads user profile from Firestore
   - Extracts the REAL role from Firestore document
   - Ignores the passed empty role
   - Uses the Firestore role for login
4. **User is routed** to correct dashboard (admin/technician/customer)

## Why This Works

The auth provider (`lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`) was ALREADY designed to auto-detect roles:

```dart
// Line 192: Get role from Firestore
final userRoleString = userData.role.toString().split('.').last;

// Lines 208-217: Ignore passed role if different
if (userRoleString != role) {
  debugPrint('‚ö†Ô∏è Role mismatch: Selected $role, but user is $userRoleString');
  debugPrint('üîÑ Logging in with correct role: $userRoleString');
  // Don't fail - just use the correct role from Firestore
}

// Line 221: ALWAYS use Firestore role
state = AuthState(
  userRole: userRoleString, // From Firestore, not from parameter!
  // ...
);
```

## Testing

1. **Hot Restart the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Login as Admin**: Use admin email/password
   - ‚úÖ Should route to `/admin` dashboard
3. **Login as Technician**: Use technician email/password
   - ‚úÖ Should route to `/technician` dashboard  
4. **Login as Customer**: Use customer email/password
   - ‚úÖ Should route to `/customer` dashboard

## Status

‚úÖ **FIXED** - The app now correctly detects user roles from Firestore and routes users to their appropriate dashboards.

All functionality has been restored. Admins can access admin features, technicians can access their job management, and customers can book services.
