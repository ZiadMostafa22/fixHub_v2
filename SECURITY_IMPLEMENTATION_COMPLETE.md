## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Update Firestore Security Rules

1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Copy the rules from `firestore.rules` file
5. Paste them into the Firebase Console
6. Click **Publish**

### Step 2: Create Your First Admin Account

Choose one method from `FIRST_ADMIN_SETUP.md`:

**Recommended Method:**
1. Register as a customer in the app
2. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → users collection
3. Find your user document
4. Change `role` from `"customer"` to `"admin"`
5. Restart the app and login
6. You're now an admin!

### Step 3: Test the Security System

Run these tests:

#### ✅ Test 1: Customer Registration (Should Work)
```
1. Open registration page
2. Select "Customer Account"
3. Fill in details
4. Register
Expected: Success, redirects to customer dashboard
```

#### ✅ Test 2: Technician Without Code (Should Fail)
```
1. Open registration page
2. Select "Technician Account"
3. Leave invite code empty or enter invalid code
4. Try to register
Expected: Error "Invite code is required"
```

#### ✅ Test 3: Generate and Use Invite Code (Should Work)
```
1. Login as admin
2. Click key icon (🔑)
3. Generate technician invite code
4. Logout
5. Register new account with code
Expected: Success, creates technician account
```

#### ✅ Test 4: Admin Access (Should Be Restricted)
```
1. Try to access /admin/invite-codes as customer
Expected: Denied or redirected
2. Access as admin
Expected: Shows invite codes management page
```

### Step 4: Generate Invite Codes for Your Team

1. Login as admin
2. Click the key icon (🔑) in the admin dashboard
3. For each technician:
   - Role: Technician
   - Max Uses: 1
   - Click "Generate Code"
   - Copy and share the code securely

## 📊 Invite Code Structure

When you generate an invite code, this is created in Firestore:

```json
{
  "code": "ABC12345",           // 8-character unique code
  "role": "technician",         // "technician" or "admin"
  "maxUses": 1,                 // How many times it can be used
  "usedCount": 0,               // Current usage count
  "isActive": true,             // Active/inactive status
  "createdAt": "2025-10-11...", // When it was created
  "createdBy": "adminUserId",   // Who created it
  "usedBy": []                  // Array of user IDs who used it
}
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### For Production Use

1. **Always use single-use codes** (`maxUses: 1`)
2. **Share codes through secure channels** (encrypted messaging, in-person)
3. **Deactivate codes after use** (or let them auto-deactivate)
4. **Keep at least 2 admin accounts** (for backup)
5. **Review active codes regularly** (weekly)
6. **Delete old codes** (monthly cleanup)
7. **Monitor user registrations** (check new users)

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Firestore security rules published
- [ ] First admin account created
- [ ] Tested customer registration
- [ ] Tested technician registration with code
- [ ] Tested invite code generation
- [ ] Tested code deactivation
- [ ] Verified admin-only access to invite codes

#### "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Update Firestore security rules
- Copy rules from `firestore.rules`
- Publish in Firebase Console

#### Can't access Invite Codes page
