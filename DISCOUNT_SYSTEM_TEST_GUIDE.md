## Step 4: Check the Console for Debug Messages

If the Apply button doesn't work or shows an error, check the console/debug output for messages like:

```
üîç Validating discount code: SPRING20
üîç Searching for code: SPRING20
üîç Found 1 matching offers
üîç Offer data: {title: 20% Spring Discount, ...}
üîç Offer parsed: 20% Spring Discount, discount: 20%
‚úÖ Discount code valid! 20% off
```

If you see errors like:
- `‚ùå Error validating code: ...` - There's a Firebase error
- `üîç Found 0 matching offers` - The code doesn't exist or is inactive
- `üîç Offer expired` - The end date has passed
- `üîç No discount percentage` - The offer doesn't have a discount percentage

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Invalid discount code"
**Cause**: The code doesn't exist in Firestore or is inactive
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you created the offer as admin
- Check that the code field was filled in
- Verify the offer is marked as "Active"
- Make sure you're entering the code exactly (codes are case-insensitive)

### Issue 2: Nothing happens when clicking "Apply"
**Cause**: Possible Firestore rules or connection issue
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you deployed the Firestore rules that allow reading offers:
  ```
  firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
  ```
- Check the console for error messages

### Issue 3: "This code is not valid for discounts"
**Cause**: The offer exists but has no discount percentage
**Solution**:
- Edit the offer and add a discount percentage value

### Issue 4: Create Booking button doesn't work
**Cause**: Form validation errors
**Solution**:
- Make sure all required fields are filled (car, service, date, time)
- Check the console for error messages

## Testing the Complete Flow

1. **Admin creates** offer with code "TEST20" and 20% discount
2. **Customer views** offer in Offers tab and sees code
3. **Customer books** service and applies "TEST20" code
4. **Booking is created** with discount information stored
5. **Technician completes** the service and adds costs (e.g., $100)
6. **Customer views** invoice/PDF showing:
   - Subtotal: $100.00
   - Discount (20%): -$20.00 (Code: TEST20)
   - Tax (10%): $8.00
   - **TOTAL: $88.00**
