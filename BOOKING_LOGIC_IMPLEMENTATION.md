## 🔄 **DATA FLOW**

### **How Bookings are Loaded:**

```
1. User logs in
2. Dashboard loads (initState triggered)
3. bookingProvider.loadBookings(userId) called
4. carProvider.loadCars(userId) called
5. Firebase Firestore queries:
   - bookings collection WHERE userId = current user
   - cars collection WHERE userId = current user
6. Data stored in provider state
7. Widgets automatically rebuild with new data
```

## 📊 **BOOKING STATUS WORKFLOW**

### **Status Progression:**
```
1. pending     →  Created by customer
2. confirmed   →  Confirmed by admin/system
3. inProgress  →  Technician started work
4. completed   →  Service finished
```

**Special Status:**
```
cancelled  →  Customer or admin cancelled
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Data Loading:**

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    final user = ref.read(authProvider).user;
    if (user != null) {
      ref.read(bookingProvider.notifier).loadBookings(user.id);
      ref.read(carProvider.notifier).loadCars(user.id);
    }
  });
}
```

### **Filtering Upcoming:**
```dart
final upcomingBookings = bookingState.bookings.where((booking) {
  return booking.status == BookingStatus.pending ||
         booking.status == BookingStatus.confirmed ||
         booking.status == BookingStatus.inProgress;
}).toList();
```

### **Filtering Completed:**
```dart
final completedBookings = bookingState.bookings.where((booking) {
  return booking.status == BookingStatus.completed;
}).toList();
```

### **Sorting:**
```dart
// By scheduled date (upcoming)
upcomingBookings.sort((a, b) => a.scheduledDate.compareTo(b.scheduledDate));

// By completion date (recent)
completedBookings.sort((a, b) {
  final aDate = a.completedAt ?? a.updatedAt;
  final bDate = b.completedAt ?? b.updatedAt;
  return bDate.compareTo(aDate); // Newest first
});
```
