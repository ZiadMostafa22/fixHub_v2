2. **Secure Invite Codes**: Share invite codes through secure channels (encrypted messaging, in-person, etc.)
3. **Single-Use Codes**: Use `maxUses: 1` for better security and tracking
4. **Deactivate Old Codes**: Regularly review and deactivate unused invite codes
5. **Multiple Admins**: Create at least 2 admin accounts for redundancy
6. **Regular Audits**: Check user list regularly for unauthorized accounts

### üö® If You Lose Admin Access

If you lose access to all admin accounts:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Find any user document
4. Change their role to `admin`
5. Login with that user's credentials
6. Immediately create a new proper admin account
7. Consider revoking the temporary admin access

- Logout and login again
- Clear app cache
- Check Firebase Console for user role
